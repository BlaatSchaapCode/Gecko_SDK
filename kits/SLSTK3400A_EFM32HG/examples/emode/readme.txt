Select a single energy mode, and stay there.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS and demonstrates the use of
the LCD display, RTC (real time counter), GPIO and various Energy
Modes (EM).

Use PB1 to cycle through the energy mode tests available.
Press PB0 to start selected test.

This demo application has been made to give a quick demo of the
energyAware Profiler from Silicon Labs, including EFM32 energy modes.
